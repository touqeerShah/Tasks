## Tasks
### Part 1

Challenge: Companyâ€™s stakeholders want to get a list of all BAR token (ERC20) transfers where the from OR
the to is part of a given list and have happened over the last X years.

Write a code snippet in your preferred language without using a 3rd party provider (like Alchemy, Moralis, ...).
Then describe how you could improve your code by using a modern approach and keeping in mind security,
scalability, maintainability, speed, use of 3rd party tools, etc..

### Part 2

Challenge: The company wants to create a platform where users could stake their tokens. This will allow users
to participate in (vote) different Surveys. When a user stakes some amount of a particular token (ex: BAR) it
gives them the possibility to vote on any survey linked to that token (ie: BAR).

Design an upgradeable smart contracts architecture to tackle this challenge. Consider security risks and
maintainability.
Describe possible improvements. Eventually provide a diagram.
